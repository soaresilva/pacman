# Coding Bootcamp Praha Hackathon #2: Creating a Pacman-like game

A little Pacman-like web application built with vanilla JS during a six-hours long hackathon.

ø Tools used in this project:

— JavaScript;

— HTML5;

— SASS/SCSS for styling;

— Git for version control;

— Yarn as a package manager.

ø Instructions:

— Please run <i>npm/yarn run watch</i> to properly view the application.

— Use the directional keys to move 1Pac across the maze, eating all the apples to get some points and avoiding bombs along the way —  you only have a 50% chance of survival if you eat one of those. Refresh the page to generate a completely new maze.
